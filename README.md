Repo for my capstone project

Description:
An app that lets you select from a multitude of video game genres and gives you a list of games within that same genre.
GameApp is a videogame focused webapp that allows a user to search through different genres and be shown games that fall 
under that genre. Each genre is explained based on information from the RAWG API, alongside photos that depict the genre. 
A user can explore many different games, see photos of the game, and add games to a favorite section on their user profile, 
so they may access them later.

Tech Stack:
PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Jinja, Python, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JSON

Motivation:
I really wanted to make my project based on my love for video games. I love gaming, especially RPGs that have a huge world to explore. 
I hope to one day be able to be a part of a team that creates, designs, or is somehow conected to video games!

API: 
I made this with RAWG API
